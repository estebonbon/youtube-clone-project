# YouTube Clone Project

A simple front-end clone of YouTube, created as part of a tutorial by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/c/SuperSimpleDev). This project replicates the basic layout and design of YouTube's home page.

## Key Features
- A responsive YouTube-style layout.
- Static video thumbnails with mock titles and metadata.
- Real anchor links for:
  - Videos: Clicking on a video thumbnail redirects to a mock video page.
  - Channels: Clicking on a channel name or avatar opens a channel page.
- Navigation bar mimicking YouTube's header design.
- Sidebar with clickable links (non-functional).
- Responsive grid for video previews.

## Purpose
This project was created to practice and solidify front-end development skills, including:
- HTML5 for structuring web pages.
- CSS3 for layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- Flexbox and Grid for building responsive designs.
- JavaScript for basic interactivity.

## Technologies Used
